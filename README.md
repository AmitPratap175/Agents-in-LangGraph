# Agents-in-LangGraph

This repository explores **LangGraph**, a framework built on **LangChain** for creating structured, multi-agent workflows using graph-based execution.

## Features  

### **LangChain**  
- **LLM Integration** – Seamlessly connects with large language models (GPT, Claude, etc.).  
- **Memory & Context** – Enables agents to recall past interactions.  
- **Tool Use** – Allows agents to interact with APIs, databases, and external tools.  
- **Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG)** – Enhances responses with external knowledge sources.  

### **LangGraph**  
- **Graph-Based Execution** – Enables structured agent collaboration through directed graphs.  
- **Parallel & Asynchronous Agents** – Supports concurrent multi-agent interactions.  
- **Customizable Workflows** – Define task-specific agent behaviors.  
- **State Management** – Efficiently tracks agent states and transitions.  

This project demonstrates how **LangChain** and **LangGraph** can be used to build powerful multi-agent systems with structured reasoning and decision-making.
